CAPE (Code Afrique Python Editor -- with a wink to Cape Coast), is
an editor for Python programs.  It was inspired by trying to teach
500 Ghanaian students how to code in Python in just two days.
Trouble was, the students were having a lot of trouble with the
syntax.  Much more so than with the programming principles.  Learning
syntax is boring and can be frustrating.

The problem comes from programming using text editors to enter
programs.  A text editor is used to enter characters left to right,
but a program is essentially a tree of statements.  The syntax of
a program encodes the tree structured in the linear text.  In the
case of Python, such encoding include the following constructs:

	- indentation for blocks of statements
	- use of precedence to know which operators are executed first
	- use of brackets '()' to encode exceptions to these rules
	- use of escape characters in strings

CAPE gets around all this by presenting the program in the tree
structure that it is.  For those who know what it is, CAPE directly
manipulates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  As a result, it becomes
virtually impossible to create programs that are syntactically
broken.  CAPE completely does away with the concept of "lines of code"
(and, with it, line numbers).  CAPE reads and stores Python programs,
but only as a representation of the AST---you can't edit the Python
program directly in CAPE.
