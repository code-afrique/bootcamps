def solve(a,b,c):
	"""
	Prints the two solutions of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0
	Requirements:
	a: integer
	b: integer
	c: integer

	Instructions: 
	step 1: Use the quadratic formula to compute the two solutions x1 and x2
			eg. x1 = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/2a
	step 2: Now that you have x1 and x2 use the print_step_by_step function
			to print out the solution using factorization method.
			eg. 
			x1 = -1
			x2 = 5
			print_step_by_step(x1,x2)
