This is an implementation of a calculator implemented in HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) and JavaScript.

The calculator is incomplete, because the button and code for multiplication is missing.  It is your job to fix this.

Other projects:
	- add a button for a decimat dot
	- add a "+/-" button that changes the sign of the value
	- add other operations: square root, abs, ...
	- add a "memory"
		- M+: add to memory
		- MR: recall from memory
		- MC: clear memory
