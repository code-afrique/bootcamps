To use this, create a file called "part.tex" with the names and
schools of students in the following format:

\cert{Agbovi Eugene}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}
\cert{Theophilus Nyarko}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}
\cert{Nenyo - Jenkins Jehoiada}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}
\cert{Richard Mensah}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}

Then run

pdflatex cert

which will create a file "cert.pdf" with all the certificates.  It
also creates a few empty certificates for filling out by hand.
