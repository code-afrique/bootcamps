To generate certificate, generate a CSV input file with student names
and school names.  (From spreadsheet menu, use "save as CSV file".
For example

Agbovi Eugene,Aggrey Memorial SHS
Theophilus Nyarko,Aggrey Memorial SHS
Nenyo - Jenkins Jehoiada,Aggrey Memorial SHS
Richard Mensah,Aggrey Memorial SHS

Then run:
	./gencerts name-of-file.csv

This will create a file "cert.pdf" with all the certificates.  It
also creates a few empty certificates for filling out by hand.

===============

If you want to know how it works:  gencerts converts the .csv file
into the following format:

\cert{Agbovi Eugene}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}
\cert{Theophilus Nyarko}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}
\cert{Nenyo - Jenkins Jehoiada}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}
\cert{Richard Mensah}{Aggrey Memorial SHS}

This is stored in "part.tex".  It then runs

pdflatex cert

which will create a file "cert.pdf" with all the certificates.
